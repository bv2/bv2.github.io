title: "About me"
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the German Cancer Research Center in the [Division of Computational Genomics and System Genetics](https://www.dkfz.de/en/bioinformatik-genomik-systemgenetik/index.php) . 

I am mathematician by training and obtained a PhD in statistics from ETH Zurich and EMBL Heidelberg working with [Peter BÃ¼hlmann](https://math.ethz.ch/research/seminar-for-statistics/peter-buehlmann.html) and [Wolfgang Huber](https://www.huber.embl.de). Since 2019, I am postdoc at the German Cancer Research Center and the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk) in Cambridge. As a visiting researcher I worked with [Susan Holmes at Stanford University](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html) and with [Dagmar Iber at D-BSSE](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cobi).

In my research, I aim to apply statistical reasoning in combination with modern machine learning approaches to gain insights into fundamental processes that underlie complex biological systems and dissect the molecular heterogeneity of biological processes. For this I develop statistical methods and computational tools to analyse and integrate 'omics data and apply them in a variety of fields including personalized medicine, cancer biology, single cell biology and developmental biology. The tools and methods I develop are available from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org), [PyPI](https://pypi.org) and GitHub.
