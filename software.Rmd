Most of my software as well as vignettes and scripts for the analyses connnected to my research can be found on my [ GitHub page](https://github.com/bv2). In addition, I maintain the following software packages in Bioconductor:

## MOFA

MOFA provides a statistical framework for the unsupervised integration of multi-modal data.


- Our latest version MOFA2 under review for Bioconductor and currently available from GitHub at [https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2) 
- MOFA version 1: Bioconductor package [MOFA](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MOFA.html) (linked to the Python package [mofapy](https://pypi.org/project/mofapy/))

*For information on MOFA please also visit our webpage at [https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/](https://biofam.github.io/MOFA2/). There you will find installation instructions, tutorials, FAQs and a link to a Slack group to get help.*
