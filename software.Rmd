Most of my software as well as vignettes and scripts for the analyses connnected to my research can be found on my [ GitHub page](https://github.com/bv2). In addition, I maintain the following software packages in Bioconductor:

## MOFA

MOFA provides a statistical framework for the unsupervised integration of multi-modal data.

- Our latest version MOFA2 available from GitHub at [https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2](https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2) 
- MOFA version 1: Bioconductor package [MOFA](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MOFA.html) (linked to the Python package [mofapy](https://pypi.org/project/mofapy/))

*If you are interested in using MOFA for your research please check out the newest version on GitHub. This includes tutorials, FAQs and a link to a Slack group to get help*

## graper

graper performs high-dimensional regression with adaptive penalization based on side-information about the features.
